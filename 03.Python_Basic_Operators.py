# Python Operators
  # Arithmetic operators
  # Comparison operators
  # Assignment operators
  # Logical operators

# ===== Arithmetic operators =====
  # + Addition
  # - subtraction
  # * multiplication
  # / division
  # % modulus
  # // floor division[ floor division 9 // 2 = 4 ]
  # ** exponent 2**4 = 2*2*2*2 = 16 
  
x = 9 / 3
print(type(x)) # = 3.0  => float
print(type(int(x))) # = 3 => int
 
y = 9 // 2  # = 4 => int
print(type(y)) # int

x = "Hani " + "Ali"
print(x)
y = "10" + "20"
print(y) #  1020
    #   y = "10" + "20"
    #   print(y) # TypeErro => not division 'str' / 'str' 

# ===== Comparison operators =====
  # == equal
  # != not equal  => x != 10 => Is x = 10? //question
  # >  greater then
  # < less than
  # >= greater than or equal to
  # <= less than or eqaul to

# ===== Assignment operators =====
  # = assign  value =>  x = 10
  # += add and assignment
  # -= subtract and assignment
  # *= multiply and assignment
  # /= divide and assignment
  # //= floor division and  assignment
  # %= modulus and assignment
  # **= exponent and assignment

# ====== Logical operators ======
  # and = Returns True if both statements are true => x == 2 and y == 3
  # or  = Returns True if one of the statements is true => x == 2 or y == 3
  # not = Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true => not(x < 5 and x < 10)
